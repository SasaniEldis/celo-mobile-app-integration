# celo-mobile-app-integration
A simple tutorial on how to integrate smart contracts on Celo Blockchain with a mobile app

The convergence of blockchain technology and mobile application development has given rise to an innovative ecosystem where decentralized applications (dApps) provide solutions that are secure, transparent, and user-friendly. One such ecosystem is Celo, a mobile-first blockchain platform that is making financial tools accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. Central to Celo's ecosystem are smart contracts, programmable scripts that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or execution of a digital contract.

## Prerequisite

To get the most from this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and mobile application development. Familiarity with the Solidity programming language and mobile development frameworks like React Native or Flutter is also essential. It will also be helpful if you are comfortable using libraries and SDKs for blockchain integration.

## Requirements

To follow along, you will need:

- Development environment setup for mobile applications (React Native or Flutter)
- Celo SDK or library for integration
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A Celo Wallet or Celo extension wallet.
- React Native CLI installed.

## Tutorial Content

The tutorial will cover the following topics:

1. Fundamentals of smart contracts and their role in the Celo ecosystem.
2. Introduction to Solidity, a programming language for Celo smart contracts.
3. Overview of mobile development frameworks (React Native or Flutter) for building apps.
4. Integration of Celo blockchain with mobile apps using libraries and SDKs.
5. Handling wallet interactions, enabling transactions, and retrieving data from the blockchain.
6. Managing events, deploying contracts, and managing gas fees in a mobile environment.
7. Optimizing user experience by efficiently querying and updating smart contract data from mobile devices.

## Building a Simple Celo Mobile App Linked with Celo Wallet

In this tutorial, we will build a simple app that retrieves the balance of a Celo account. The tutorial assumes you have set up the necessary development environment for mobile applications (React Native or Flutter) and have installed the required dependencies.

### Step 1: Set Up a New React Native Project

In your terminal, create a new React Native project:

```bash
npx react-native init CeloApp
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
We will use @celo/contractkit to interact with the Celo blockchain and web3 for some utility functions. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CeloApp
```
Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install @celo/contractkit web3
```

### Step 3: Interacting with the Celo Network
Create a new file CeloClient.js in the project directory and add the following code:

```js

import { newKit } from '@celo/contractkit';

const kit = newKit('https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org');

export default kit;
```
### Step 4: Fetching Account Balance
In the CeloClient.js file, add the following function to fetch the balance of a Celo account:

```js
export const getBalance = async (address) => {
  const totalBalance = await kit.getTotalBalance(address);
  return totalBalance.celo.toString();
};
```
### Step 5: Display Balance in React Native
Open App.js in your project directory and replace its contents with the following code:

```js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text, Button } from 'react-native';
import { getBalance } from './CeloClient';

const App = () => {
  const [balance, setBalance] = useState(null);

  const fetchBalance = async () => {
    const celoBalance = await getBalance('0xYourCeloAddress');
    setBalance(celoBalance);
  };

  useEffect(() => {
    fetchBalance();
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Your Celo Balance: {balance}</Text>
      <Button title="Refresh" onPress={fetchBalance} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```
Replace **'0xYourCeloAddress'** with your actual Celo account address.

## Conclusion
Congratulations! You have successfully built a simple Celo mobile app that retrieves the balance of a Celo account. This tutorial has provided an introduction to integrating smart contracts with mobile apps in the Celo ecosystem. You can further explore DeFi mobile application integration by following up with additional tutorials on smart contract integration with mobile apps in the Celo blockchain.

Remember to implement authentication, error handling, and more complex smart contract interactions for real-world applications. Ensure that you never expose sensitive data, like private keys, within your application code.
