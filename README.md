# Celo Mobile App Integration Tutorial

## Introduction

The integration of blockchain technology and mobile application development has given rise to an innovative ecosystem where decentralized applications (dApps) provide solutions that are secure, transparent, and user-friendly. One such ecosystem is Celo, a mobile-first blockchain platform that aims to make financial tools accessible to anyone with a mobile phone. Central to Celo's ecosystem are smart contracts, programmable scripts that facilitate, verify, or enforce the negotiation or execution of a digital contract.

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this tutorial, you should have a basic understanding of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and mobile application development. Familiarity with the Solidity programming language and mobile development frameworks like React Native or Flutter is also essential. It will also be helpful if you are comfortable using libraries and SDKs for blockchain integration.

## Requirements

To follow along, you will need:

- Development environment setup for mobile applications (React Native or Flutter)
- Celo SDK or library for integration
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- A Celo Wallet or Celo extension wallet.
- React Native CLI installed.

We will start by discussing the fundamentals of smart contracts and their role in the Celo ecosystem. Next, we will delve into the specifics of Solidity, a programming language that allows us to write smart contracts for the Celo blockchain. Solidity's syntax is similar to JavaScript, which makes it a favorable choice for developers.

We will explore mobile development frameworks, such as React Native or Flutter, that enable you to develop apps for both iOS and Android platforms. We will showcase how these frameworks can be used to build apps that interact with smart contracts deployed on the Celo blockchain.

You will learn how to connect your mobile app to the Celo blockchain using libraries and SDKs designed for Celo. We will guide you through handling wallet interactions, enabling transactions, and retrieving data from the blockchain.

We will then discuss how to handle events, deploy contracts, and manage gas fees in a mobile environment. We will also talk about optimizing user experience by efficiently querying and updating smart contract data from mobile devices.

## Building a Simple Celo Mobile App Linked with Celo Wallet

Let's build a simple app that retrieves the balance of a Celo account.

**Step 1: Set Up a New React Native Project**

In your terminal, create a new React Native project:

```bash
npx react-native init CeloApp
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

We will use @celo/contractkit to interact with the Celo blockchain and web3 for some utility functions:

```bash
cd CeloApp
npm install @celo/contractkit web3
```
### Step 3: Interacting with Celo Network

Create a new file CeloClient.js:

```javascript
import { newKit } from '@celo/contractkit';
const kit = newKit('https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org');

export default kit;
```
Here we're connecting to the Alfajores Testnet.

### Step 4: Fetching Account Balance

Create a new function that will fetch the balance of a Celo account. Add the following function to the CeloClient.js file:

```javascript
import { newKit } from '@celo/contractkit';

const kit = newKit('https://alfajores-forno.celo-testnet.org');

export const getBalance = async (address) => {
  const totalBalance = await kit.getTotalBalance(address);
  return totalBalance.celo.toString();
};
```
### Step 5: Display Balance in Your App

Now, let's use this function in our app to display the balance of a Celo account. Open the App.js file and modify it as follows:

```javascript
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { getBalance } from './CeloClient';

const App = () => {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchBalance();
  }, []);

  const fetchBalance = async () => {
    const celoBalance = await getBalance('0xYourCeloAddress');
    console.log('Your Celo Balance:', celoBalance);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Your Celo Balance: {celoBalance}</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default App;
```
Replace '0xYourCeloAddress' with your own Celo account address.

This is a basic example that demonstrates how to interact with Celo's smart contracts using React Native. For real-world apps, you'll need to implement authentication, error handling, more complex smart contract interactions, etc. Also, remember that you should never expose sensitive data, like private keys, within your application code.
